  Since our inception in September '20 we've been making noise in the local Jozi rock scene, and are very proud to present our first nose-bleed-inducing single - 'Demeanour'.
  Give it a listen, you might get reeled inâ€¦
  Watch this space - we're aiming to get more of our original content out to the masses! `
